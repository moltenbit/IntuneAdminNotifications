Custom Admin Notifications for New Intune Enrollments

This script lets you send custom e-mail notifications to your admins when new devices enroll into Intune.  
It can be run on a Linux server and uses the Graph API to periodically download a list of all device names.

The guide on how to set it up can be found on my blog here:
